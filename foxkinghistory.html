				A tidbit about our fearless leader, CEO, CFO and role model!
				</h3>
				<p>
					So Fresh and So Clean! It was a hard day of work, Sean Harrison Campbell was toiling away in the fields, creating that ever so satisfying stench. Well, it was satisfying to Sean, but not so much to others.  He was alone and longed for friends.  The problem was he didn't know how to get rid of the smell he had become so accustomed to.  Then one day while boiling animal fat he smelt a wonderful fragrance and realized he could capture this and even create new ones.  This was the beginning of soap! Sean developed over 50 varieties of exotic fragrances that allowed him to smell like a new adventure everyday.  He gained friends, fame and fortune all from soap.  Now it is our dream to share this gift with you. The gift of smelling amazing can be yours for a reasonable price!
