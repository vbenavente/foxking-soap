					About Us
				</h3>
				<img src=>
				<p>
					Fox King Soap is locally made in Tacoma, Washington. It is a all natural blend of coco butter, avocado oil, extra virgin olive oil, and our signature fragrances. It is safe for use by those with sensitive skin, yet offers a bold, masculine scent. It is hypoallergenic, never tested on animals, and human-fat free. <br/> <br/> The soap which the Fox King commands you to use is both good for you and good FOR YOU. The benevolent supreme Fox King Leader, makes the soap out of unicorn tears from the legendary herd of unicorns that only the benevolent Fox King could corral. It is such an amazing honor to be chosen to bath with a product fashoned by the benevolent supreme Fox King's own powerful hands.
